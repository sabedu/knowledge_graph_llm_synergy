The issue is titled \"`omz plugin disable` breaks .zshrc file when disabling common substring\". The problem occurs when running the command `omz plugin disable git`, which results in the `.zshrc` file being incorrectly modified. Specifically, the `git` plugin gets removed, but it also inadvertently affects the `git-open` plugin, leading to a malformed plugins list. For example, the plugins list:\n\n```shell\nplugins=(\n    git\n    git-open\n    autoupdate\n    zsh-syntax-highlighting\n    zsh-autosuggestions\n    autojump\n    brew\n    docker\n    fzf\n    rust\n    thefuck\n    zsh-interactive-cd\n    zsh-bat\n    asdf\n)\n```\n\ngets altered to:\n\n```shell\nplugins=(\n    autoupdate\n-open\n    zsh-syntax-highlighting\n    zsh-autosuggestions\n    autojump\n    brew\n    docker\n    fzf\n    rust\n    thefuck\n    zsh-interactive-cd\n    zsh-bat\n    asdf\n)\n```\n\nThe issue also manifests when the plugins are listed on a single line, leading to similar corruption of the list.",

Set up OhMyZsh\r\n2. Set up plugins, for example:\r\n```shell\r\nplugins=(git autoupdate git-open zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-autosuggestions autojump brew docker fzf rust thefuck zsh-interactive-cd zsh-bat asdf)\r\n```\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n```shell\r\nplugins=(\r\n    git\r\n    autoupdate\r\n    git-open\r\n    zsh-syntax-highlighting\r\n    zsh-autosuggestions\r\n    autojump\r\n    brew\r\n    docker\r\n    fzf\r\n    rust\r\n    thefuck\r\n    zsh-interactive-cd\r\n    zsh-bat\r\n    asdf\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. run `omz plugin disable git` \r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe `git` plugin gets removed, and the `git-open` plugin isnt impacted.

The problem occurs in Debian Buster with zsh 5.7.1 (x86_64-debian-linux-gnu), where the debian plugin in OMZ gives parse errors. Specifically, the errors are related to defining functions based on aliases without the \"function\" keyword, leading to parse errors.

However, the actual result is that it incorrectly modifies the `.zshrc` file by breaking the plugin list, such as turning:\n```shell\nplugins=(\n    git\n    autoupdate\n    git-open\n    zsh-syntax-highlighting\n    zsh-autosuggestions\n    autojump\n    brew\n    docker\n    fzf\n    rust\n    thefuck\n    zsh-interactive-cd\n    zsh-bat\n    asdf\n)\n```\ninto:\n```shell\nplugins=(\n    autoupdate\n-open\n    zsh-syntax-highlighting\n    zsh-autosuggestions\n    autojump\n    brew\n    docker\n    fzf\n    rust\n    thefuck\n    zsh-interactive-cd\n    zsh-bat\n    asdf\n)\n```\n\nThis behavior occurs both when the plugins are listed on multiple lines or on a single line.

Set up OhMyZsh\r\n2. Set up plugins, for example:\r\n```shell\r\nplugins=(git autoupdate git-open zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-autosuggestions autojump brew docker fzf rust thefuck zsh-interactive-cd zsh-bat asdf)\r\n```\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n```shell\r\nplugins=(\r\n    git\r\n    autoupdate\r\n    git-open\r\n    zsh-syntax-highlighting\r\n    zsh-autosuggestions\r\n    autojump\r\n    brew\r\n    docker\r\n    fzf\r\n    rust\r\n    thefuck\r\n    zsh-interactive-cd\r\n    zsh-bat\r\n    asdf\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. run `omz plugin disable git` \r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe `git` plugin gets removed, and the `git-open` plugin isnt impacted.  This isnt quite what happens though, the actual result is:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nplugins=(\r\n    autoupdate\r\n-open\r\n    zsh-syntax-highlighting\r\n    zsh-autosuggestions\r\n    autojump\r\n    brew\r\n    docker\r\n    fzf\r\n    rust\r\n    thefuck\r\n    zsh-interactive-cd\r\n    zsh-bat\r\n    asdf\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote - the same behavior happens when `plugins` is one line:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# this:\r\nplugins=(git autoupdate git-open zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-autosuggestions autojump brew docker fzf rust thefuck zsh-interactive-cd zsh-bat asdf)\r\n\r\n# gets turned into:\r\nplugins=(autoupdate-open zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-autosuggestions autojump brew docker fzf rust thefuck zsh-interactive-cd zsh-bat asdf)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots and recordings\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### OS / Linux distribution\r\n\r\nmacOS\r\n\r\n### Zsh version\r\n\r\n5.9\r\n\r\n### Oh My Zsh version\r\n\r\nmaster (668ca3a)\r\n\r\n### Terminal emulator\r\n\r\niTerm2\r\n\r\n### If using WSL on Windows, which version of WSL\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_\"",

The issue, titled \"parse errors for functions in debian.plugin.zsh,\" was created on 2019-07-10 and closed on 2019-09-08. The problem occurs in Debian Buster with zsh version 5.7.1, where the debian plugin in OMZ gives parse errors when defining functions based on aliases without the \"function\" keyword. The specific parse error message is:\n\n```\n/home/username/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/debian/debian.plugin.zsh:75: defining function based on alias `abd  \n/home/username/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/debian/debian.plugin.zsh:75: parse error near `()\n```\n\nThis issue can be fixed by adding the \"function\" keyword to all the functions defined in the section, specifically on lines 75, 86, 91, and 96. The steps to reproduce the error include enabling the \"debian\" plugin in zshrc, sourcing ~/.zshrc, and receiving the parse error. The expected behavior is that the plugin should load without issue rather than causing parse errors.\n\nFor more details, you can view the issue [here](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/issues/7986).",

The issue, titled `\"parse errors for functions in debian.plugin.zsh\"`, was created on `2019-07-10` and closed on `2019-09-08`. The problem described involves parse errors in the debian plugin in OMZ (Oh My Zsh) for Debian Buster, zsh 5.7.1. Specifically, the errors occur because functions are being defined without the \"function\" keyword, leading to parse errors like:\n\n```\n/home/username/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/debian/debian.plugin.zsh:75: defining function based on alias `abd  \n/home/username/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/debian/debian.plugin.zsh:75: parse error near `()\n```\n\nTo fix this, the \"function\" keyword needs to be added to all the functions defined in that section.

The issue is titled \"`omz plugin disable` breaks .zshrc file when disabling common substring.\" The bug occurs when using the command `omz plugin disable git`, which breaks the `.zshrc` file by incorrectly modifying the `plugins` array. Instead of only removing the `git` plugin, it also affects the `git-open` plugin and other plugins in the array, leading to an incorrect configuration. For example, the `plugins` array may be transformed from:\n\n```shell\nplugins=(\n    git\n    autoupdate\n    git-open\n    zsh-syntax-highlighting\n    zsh-autosuggestions\n    autojump\n    brew\n    docker\n    fzf\n    rust\n    thefuck\n    zsh-interactive-cd\n    zsh-bat\n    asdf\n)\n```\n\nto:\n\n```shell\nplugins=(\n    autoupdate\n-open\n    zsh-syntax-highlighting\n    zsh-autosuggestions\n    autojump\n    brew\n    docker\n    fzf\n    rust\n    thefuck\n    zsh-interactive-cd\n    zsh-bat\n    asdf\n)\n```\n\nThis issue was created on May 7, 2024, and was closed on May 8, 2024.

                    "body": "\"### Describe the bug\r\n\r\n`omz plugin disable git` will break a zshrc file with plugins that look like this:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nplugins=(\r\n    git\r\n    git-open\r\n    autoupdate\r\n    zsh-syntax-highlighting\r\n    zsh-autosuggestions\r\n    autojump\r\n    brew\r\n    docker\r\n    fzf\r\n    rust\r\n    thefuck\r\n    zsh-interactive-cd\r\n    zsh-bat\r\n    asdf\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Set up OhMyZsh\r\n2. Set up plugins, for example:\r\n```shell\r\nplugins=(git autoupdate git-open zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-autosuggestions autojump brew docker fzf rust thefuck zsh-interactive-cd zsh-bat asdf)\r\n```\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n```shell\r\nplugins=(\r\n    git\r\n    autoupdate\r\n    git-open\r\n    zsh-syntax-highlighting\r\n    zsh-autosuggestions\r\n    autojump\r\n    brew\r\n    docker\r\n    fzf\r\n    rust\r\n    thefuck\r\n    zsh-interactive-cd\r\n    zsh-bat\r\n    asdf\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. run `omz plugin disable git` \r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe `git` plugin gets removed, and the `git-open` plugin isnt impacted.  This isnt quite what happens though, the actual result is:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nplugins=(\r\n    autoupdate\r\n-open\r\n    zsh-syntax-highlighting\r\n    zsh-autosuggestions\r\n    autojump\r\n    brew\r\n    docker\r\n    fzf\r\n    rust\r\n    thefuck\r\n    zsh-interactive-cd\r\n    zsh-bat\r\n    asdf\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote - the same behavior happens when `plugins` is one line:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# this:\r\nplugins=(git autoupdate git-open zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-autosuggestions autojump brew docker fzf rust thefuck zsh-interactive-cd zsh-bat asdf)\r\n\r\n# gets turned into:\r\nplugins=(autoupdate-open zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-autosuggestions autojump brew docker fzf rust thefuck zsh-interactive-cd zsh-bat asdf)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots and recordings\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### OS / Linux distribution\r\n\r\nmacOS\r\n\r\n### Zsh version\r\n\r\n5.9\r\n\r\n### Oh My Zsh version\r\n\r\nmaster (668ca3a)\r\n\r\n### Terminal emulator\r\n\r\niTerm2\r\n\r\n### If using WSL on Windows, which version of WSL\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_\"",

The issue, titled \"parse errors for functions in debian.plugin.zsh,\" reports that in Debian Buster with zsh 5.7.1, the debian plugin in Oh My Zsh gives parse errors. Specifically, there are errors related to defining functions based on aliases without the \"function\" keyword, which can be fixed by adding \"function\" to all the functions defined in that section. The issue was created on July 10, 2019, and closed on September 8, 2019. You can view the full details of the issue [here](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/issues/7986).",
