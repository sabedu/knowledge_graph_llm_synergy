The issue is titled \"`omz plugin disable` breaks .zshrc file when disabling common substring\". The problem occurs when running the command `omz plugin disable git`, which results in the `.zshrc` file being incorrectly modified. Specifically, the `git` plugin gets removed, but it also inadvertently affects the `git-open` plugin, leading to a malformed plugins list. For example, the plugins list:\n\n```shell\nplugins=(\n    git\n    git-open\n    autoupdate\n    zsh-syntax-highlighting\n    zsh-autosuggestions\n    autojump\n    brew\n    docker\n    fzf\n    rust\n    thefuck\n    zsh-interactive-cd\n    zsh-bat\n    asdf\n)\n```\n\ngets altered to:\n\n```shell\nplugins=(\n    autoupdate\n-open\n    zsh-syntax-highlighting\n    zsh-autosuggestions\n    autojump\n    brew\n    docker\n    fzf\n    rust\n    thefuck\n    zsh-interactive-cd\n    zsh-bat\n    asdf\n)\n```\n\nThe issue also manifests when the plugins are listed on a single line, leading to similar corruption of the list.",

                    "body": "\"### Describe the bug\r\n\r\n`omz plugin disable git` will break a zshrc file with plugins that look like this:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nplugins=(\r\n    git\r\n    git-open\r\n    autoupdate\r\n    zsh-syntax-highlighting\r\n    zsh-autosuggestions\r\n    autojump\r\n    brew\r\n    docker\r\n    fzf\r\n    rust\r\n    thefuck\r\n    zsh-interactive-cd\r\n    zsh-bat\r\n    asdf\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Set up OhMyZsh\r\n2. Set up plugins, for example:\r\n```shell\r\nplugins=(git autoupdate git-open zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-autosuggestions autojump brew docker fzf rust thefuck zsh-interactive-cd zsh-bat asdf)\r\n```\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n```shell\r\nplugins=(\r\n    git\r\n    autoupdate\r\n    git-open\r\n    zsh-syntax-highlighting\r\n    zsh-autosuggestions\r\n    autojump\r\n    brew\r\n    docker\r\n    fzf\r\n    rust\r\n    thefuck\r\n    zsh-interactive-cd\r\n    zsh-bat\r\n    asdf\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. run `omz plugin disable git` \r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe `git` plugin gets removed, and the `git-open` plugin isnt impacted.  This isnt quite what happens though, the actual result is:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nplugins=(\r\n    autoupdate\r\n-open\r\n    zsh-syntax-highlighting\r\n    zsh-autosuggestions\r\n    autojump\r\n    brew\r\n    docker\r\n    fzf\r\n    rust\r\n    thefuck\r\n    zsh-interactive-cd\r\n    zsh-bat\r\n    asdf\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote - the same behavior happens when `plugins` is one line:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# this:\r\nplugins=(git autoupdate git-open zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-autosuggestions autojump brew docker fzf rust thefuck zsh-interactive-cd zsh-bat asdf)\r\n\r\n# gets turned into:\r\nplugins=(autoupdate-open zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-autosuggestions autojump brew docker fzf rust thefuck zsh-interactive-cd zsh-bat asdf)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots and recordings\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### OS / Linux distribution\r\n\r\nmacOS\r\n\r\n### Zsh version\r\n\r\n5.9\r\n\r\n### Oh My Zsh version\r\n\r\nmaster (668ca3a)\r\n\r\n### Terminal emulator\r\n\r\niTerm2\r\n\r\n### If using WSL on Windows, which version of WSL\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_\"",

        "response": "The bug caused by commit `65393b4bb10de841edbe2026dba29b73625b33d7` is described in issue #7986. The issue is titled `\"parse errors for functions in debian.plugin.zsh\"`. The problem occurs in Debian Buster with zsh 5.7.1 (x86_64-debian-linux-gnu), where the debian plugin in OMZ gives parse errors. Specifically, the errors are related to defining functions based on aliases without the \"function\" keyword, leading to parse errors. The issue was created on July 10, 2019, and closed on September 8, 2019. The full details can be found at [this URL](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/issues/7986).",
